You should install the corresponding version of qlib using the following command 
DFT: A Dual-branch Framework of Fluctuation and Trend for Stock Price Prediction[https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06065]
```
git clone https://github.com/SJTU-Quant/qlib.git
cd qlib
pip install .
```

Since the dataset is too large, we uploaded a test sub-dataset and a model parameter. 
You can directly run `python test_model_DFT.py` to get the test results.
